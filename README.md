## Overview

Created as a surprise gift for my boyfriend on Boyfriend Day! This is an interactive browser-based maze game where the player navigates through a playful world filled with Snoopys and characters from the Peanuts Universe! You play as TK, who must retrieve a letter for Jessica while collecting Snoopys and avoiding the girls in the maze. At the end, there’s a special cutscene, where it’s revealed who the letter was really for ❤️

## How to Play

Make sure you’re using a keyboard! 
Retrieve the letter before reaching the end, collect Snoopys, and avoid the girls blocking your way.

# Controls
Arrow keys: Navigate up/down/left/right through rooms
